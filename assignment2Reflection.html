							<p> 	
								This assignment was very insightful in terms of learning to better my research gathering skills and coordinating with my teammates to get the task done. I was responsible for gathering data through the use of surveys and doing the write up for the data collected by those surveys. The main group the surveys were distributed to were students, since students are the primary stakeholders of this application. This experience has allowed me to better understand how to gather better data through the use of surveys and how to summarize my findings effectively.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class = "center_text"> Contribution</h3>
							<p>My contribution was the collection and write up of all the relevant data for the survey research method. I made the survey questions, ran it by my team, and then distributed it to the students. Afterwards I analyzed the findings and wrote up the survey research method section of the assignment. </p>
							<p> The exact part of assignment 2 I contributed is shown below:</p>	
							
							<h2> Surveys:</h2> 
							<h3>Complimenting the other research methods:</h3>
							<p>In addition to interviews and observation, surveys were used. The surveys were used as a means of obtaining  an understanding of the majority of users. Surveys can be given to a large number of stakeholders in a short amount of time allowing for a great level of data collection. In comparison to interviews and observation, surveys allow for a more rapid but general form of data collection. This helps compliment interviews, which are slower but more precise data collection.</p> 

							<h3> Context of the research: </h3>
							<p>The majority of primary stakeholders for this project is expected to be students. As such, getting the feedback of a large number of students is quite valuable in the context of this project.</p>

							<h3> Experience conducting this method: </h3>
							<p>In terms of the survey, distributing and receiving responses from stakeholders was relatively easy. The difficulty came in coming up with proper questions that weren’t overbearing on the respondents but still allowed for insightful information to be gained. After some time however, this challenge was overcome and the survey was given to the students. For convenience of the researcher and the respondents, an online survey was used. </p>

							<h3> Reflection on use of the method: </h3>
							<p> The survey was easy to use and the respondents gave helpful and informative responses. Ideally, a larger sample size would have been better. The sample size for the survey was 22 students. If this method were to be redone, the research will try to get a larger sample size.</p>
							
							<h3> Summarizing method: </h3>
							<p>An online survey was created and distributed among the students of UWI.<br>

							<h3> Summary of findings: </h3>

							<ol>
								<li>All of the respondents were students.</li><br>
								<li>A large majority of respondents drove to school, this means there is a potential need for this product.</li><br>
								<li>Around half of the respondents reported not having trouble finding parking, however the other half did. This means at the very least, this product can provide an ease of mind to the majority of students.</li><br>
								<li>The majority of students reported being on campus in the morning period. Getting to an early class can be quite difficult, hence this can further reinforce the need for the app.</li><br>
								<li>80% of the respondents reported that they would make use of a park finding app. Comparing this to the responses for question 3, it can be ascertained that despite a majority of students not having problems finding parking, the convenience and the insurance of this application would provide value to them.</li><br>
								<li>A large amount of useful suggestions were given for the application. All of the suggestions will be considered during the making of the application. Some of these suggestions include: “Parking fees if clamped”, “where the closest park to a class is” and “how many people are headed to the same parking spot”.</li><br>
								<li>The most appealing colors to users were found to be midnight blue, turquoise and amethyst. This information will be used when creating the UI and choosing the color scheme of the application.</li><br>
