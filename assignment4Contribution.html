							<h3 class = "center_text">High Fidelity Prototype</h3>
							<p>I helped in creating the high fidelity prototype. I created the prototype based on the design requirements and the design of the low fidelity prototype. The team then gave feedback on changes that needed to be made. The final design of the high fidelity prototype is shown below:</p>
							<image src= "images/assignment4/overview.png" class = "center_img" />
							<p class = "center_text"> <b>Screenshot of all the screens for the high fidelity prototype</b></p>
							<br><br>
							
							<image src = "images/assignment4/welcomePage.png" class = "center_img"/>
							<p class = "center_text"><b>Welcome Screen</p></b>
							<br>
							<br>

							<image src = "images/assignment4/homePage.png" class = "center_img"/>
							<p class = "center_text"><b>Home Screen</p></b>
							<br>
							<br>
							
							<image src = "images/assignment4/menuPage.png" class = "center_img"/>
							<p class = "center_text"><b>Menu Screen</p></b>
							<br><br>
							
							<h3 class ="center_text">Demonstration Video</h3>

							<p>Another one of my group members did the demonstration video of the high fidelity prototype. I gave him some points to include in the video and once he had finished making it, I gave him my feedback on it. Overall, I believe he did a great job on the video.</p>

							<h3 class = "center_text">System Write-up</h3>
							<p>Another one of the group members handled the system write-up, however since I designed the high fidelity prototype, I made sure to have them include some of my design decisions, such as the reasoning for choosing the blue background.</p>

							<h3 class = "center_text">Heuristic Analysis</h3>
							<p>My team each did their own individual heuristic evaluation of the system. We then met and discussed our findings. The write up for the final heuristic analysis was left to another group member. My individual heuristic analysis is shown below:</p>
							
							<image src = "images/assignment4/he1.jfif" class = "center_img"/>
							<br>
							<image src = "images/assignment4/he2.jfif" class = "center_img"/>
							<br>

							<h3 class = "center_text">Reflection</h3>
							<p>This assignment went smoothly due to the combined effort of all the team members. Everyone had other assignments and exams to prepare for, but by coordinating and proper communication we were able to finish the assignment. I am grateful to have understanding and caring team members.</p>
							<p>For the most part the assignment was well done, however if I had more time I would like to refine the design of the prototype. A better design incorporating all the fixes from the heuristic analysis will be done for the final assignment.</p>
