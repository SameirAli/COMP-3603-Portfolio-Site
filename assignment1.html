								After some consideration, the Healthy Meal Prep app was chosen as the most promising idea. The Healthy Meal Prep app is useful to a large amount of people compared to the other two. The Healthy Meal Prep app is able to be used by individuals who simply want to diet. These individuals maybe into exercising but do not have to be. The Exercise Timer App is limited to only people who are interested in exercising. The Universal Timer Converter app is very basic in comparison to the Healthy Meal Prep App. The universal time converter app may be used once or twice a year by some individual, however if someone is dieting then they will be constantly using the Healthy Meal Prep App.
