							<p>I did 3 of the sketches for View Map and View Location. These are shown below:</p>
							<h3 class = "center_text">View Map Sketch #1</h3>

							<h3 class = "center_text">View Location Sketch #1</h3>

							<h3 class = "center_text">View Location Sketch #2</h3>

							<h3 class = "center_text">View Location Sketch #3</h3>

							<p>The main designs of my sketches were unfortunately not chosen for the final designs to be used. However, the color coded concept for View Map Sketch #1 was incorporated in the chosen version of View Map. These choices were made during the affinity diagram session. The team and I came together and finalized our thoughts on the rest of the assignment. It was decided that they would do the storyboard and video prototype and I’d do the write up for the task-centered system walkthrough.</p>

							<p>Contributions to the task-centered system walkthrough are shown below:</p>

								<thead>
									<tr>
										<th>Task step description</th>
										<th>Does the user have the knowledge/ training to do this?</th> 
										<th>Is it believable that they would do it? Are they motivated?</th>
										<th>Comments/suggested fixes</th>
									</tr>
								</thead>
								<tbody>
									<tr>
										<td> The user has to navigate the home page and find the view map feature </td>
										<td> Yes, a small amount of training may be required for the user to be able to do it efficiently </td>
										<td> The home page is designed to be intuitive. As such, the user would want to interact with the icons on screen. The names of each icon allows the user to know what they represent and be able to find the feature they wish to use. However, the ability of an individual varies greatly from person to person. As such, a very small percentage of users may require some form of training in order to efficiently use the application. </td>
										<td> A help/tutorial feature may be added, to help users who require training to effectively use the application.</td>
									</tr>

									<tr>
										<td> Determine which is the best available parking spot. </td>
										<td> Yes, the app tells the user what the colors and percentages on the map mean.</td>
										<td> The user can look at the different car parks and see how full they are based on the color of the icon, as well as the percentage displayed. These metrics would guide the user in picking the </td>
										<td> </td>
									</tr>
									
									<tr>
										<td> Selecting a parking location to view </td>
										<td> Yes, a small amount of training may be required depending on the individual’s technological competency. </td>
										<td> The pins on the map are a major focus when viewing the map. As such, it is expected that the user will tap these pins and be greeted with the option to view these parking locations. </td>
										<td> For the small number of users that would face difficulties using this feature, the help/tutorial feature would be of use to them.</td>
									</tr>
									
									<tr>
										<td> Viewing and understanding the information of the parking location page </td>
										<td> Yes, once the user has navigated to this page, they will be able to view it.</td>
										<td> It is expected that the user will observe the information presented to them and understand it. The information is organized to be intuitive to the user. A map focused on the selected cark park is given, as well as directions on how to get to that car park. </td>
										<td> </td>
									</tr>
									
									<tr>
										<td> Using the given directions to get to the desired car park. </td>
										<td> Yes, the directions are as simple as directions the user would get from another person. As such, it is expected that a large number of users will intuitively understand them. Some users may still have trouble, in this case the gps marker may help to alleviate those issues.</td>
										<td> The user would follow the instructions given to them by the app, in order to reach the car park. If the user is having trouble with following the directions, the gps marker will give them better context for the directions given.  </td>
										<td> It is possible for the user to get lost due to improperly following the directions. However, this is an error on the user’s part and the app would not be able to do much to fix this.</td>
									</tr>
									
									<tr>
										<td> Checking the menu of the application </td>
										<td> Yes, the bottom right floating menu button is common in a large number of other apps. As such the users will have previous training in using these buttons. If the user is unfamiliar with it then some training may be required.</td>
										<td> After the user has accomplished their task, they may be intrigued in the other functions of the application. As such they will use the floating menu button to see any additional features.</td>
										<td> For the users that don’t understand how to use the floating menu button. The help/tutorial feature will be of use to them </td>
									</tr>

							<p>If I had to redo this assignment, I would like to come up with more designs for the screen sketches, as well as spending more time on the task-centered system walkthrough. Overall the assignment was well done, and I am grateful to my team for their cooperation and team work.</p>
